//! # 3MF (3D Manufacturing Format) support for Rust
//!
//! This library provides support for [3MF] files to programs written in the
//! Rust programming language. 3MF is a file format commonly used for 3D
//! printing. It is typically exported from a CAD program, and imported to a
//! slicer.
//!
//!
//! [3MF]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Manufacturing_Format
//! This library was originally taken from the [Threemf crate]: <https://crates.io/crates/threemf>, however my goals deviated from the goals
//! of the original package and its maintainers as such I decided to take this into my own packages.
//! Thanks for the great work of the original maintainers.

/// The Serialization and Deserialization implementations are also provided in this module.
/// As a crate user you can use these types directly to serialize and deserialize 3MF Model element.

/// This module defines all the namespaces used by the supported 3MF Extensions by this library.
/// The default prefixes used when writing a 3MF Model is also defined here.
