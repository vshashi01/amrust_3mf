# threemf2

Library for reading and writing 3MF (3D Manufacturing Format) packages with both eager and lazy loading support.

This crate provides a compact core model representation and I/O helpers for reading/writing 3MF packages with multiple loading strategies optimized for different use cases.

## Supported 3MF Extensions and Maximum Supported Versions

| 3MF Specifications | Type      | Read<sub>1</sub> | Write<sub>2</sub> | Current supported version |
| ------------------ | --------- | :--------------: | :---------------: | ------------------------: |
| 3MF Core Spec      | Core      |       MUST       |       MUST        |                     1.3.0 |
| Triangle Set       | Extension |       MUST       |     OPTIONAL      |           Core Spec 1.3.0 |
| Production         | Extension |       MUST       |     OPTIONAL      |                     1.1.2 |
| Beam Lattice       | Extension |       MUST       |     OPTIONAL      |                     1.2.0 |

**Note: This library is still in active development, expect frequent API changes!!**

**Note<sub>1</sub>: Reading these data are currently MUST, which means if the data exists in the 3MF Model the library will automatically read it**

**Note<sub>2</sub>: Write these data are currently optional however they are available by default in the mapping of the Rust types and are not conditionally compiled.**

## Overview

threemf2 provides:

- **Core Data Structures**: Complete 3MF model representation ([`Model`](src/core/model.rs), [`Object`](src/core/object.rs), [`Mesh`](src/core/mesh.rs), etc.)
- **Multiple Loading Strategies**:
  - [`ThreemfPackage`](src/io/threemf_package.rs) - Eager loading for complete data access
  - [`ThreemfPackageLazyReader`](src/io/threemf_package_lazy_reader.rs) - Lazy loading for memory-constrained environments
- **Flexible I/O**: Support for reading/writing 3MF packages with different performance characteristics
  - Easy reading of data through query APIs.
  - Easy creation of 3MF Model through builder APIs. See [`builder_example.rs`](examples/builder_example.rs) for the most basic starter guide.
- **Extension Support**: All 3MF extensions (Production, Beam Lattice, etc.) are always available
- **Custom Parts**: Support for known parts (thumbnails) and unknown parts (custom XML data)

## Performance Options

Choose the right loading strategy for your use case:

- **Memory-Optimized**: Lower memory usage, good for large files. This is the default.
- **Speed-Optimized**: Faster parsing, higher memory usage
- **Lazy Loading**: Defers loading until accessed, best for inspection-only use cases

Key types and files:

- Core model types in [src/core/](src/core/) — `model`, `object`, `resources`, `mesh`, `transform`, etc.
- [`io::ThreemfPackage`](src/io/threemf_package.rs) — eager loading entry point
- [`io::ThreemfPackageLazyReader`](src/io/threemf_package_lazy_reader.rs) — lazy loading entry point

## Cargo Features

This crate uses optional Cargo features to control functionality. Enable only what you need.

### Core Serialization Features

- `write` — Enable writing 3MF data (adds `ToXml` derive to all 3MF types using `instant_xml`)
- `memory-optimized-read` — Enable memory-efficient reading (adds `FromXml` derive to all 3MF types using `instant_xml`)
- `speed-optimized-read` — Enable fast reading (adds `serde::Deserialize` derive to all 3MF types using `serde_roxmltree`)

### Package I/O Features

- `io-write` — Package writing with ZIP creation (requires `write`)
- `io-memory-optimized-read` — Package reading with memory optimization (requires `memory-optimized-read`)
- `io-speed-optimized-read` — Package reading with speed optimization (requires `speed-optimized-read`)
- `io-lazy-read` — Lazy loading functionality (requires `io-memory-optimized-read`)

### Default Features

`io-write`, `io-memory-optimized-read`, `io-lazy-read`, `write`, `memory-optimized-read`

### Feature Combinations

```toml
# Basic reading
threemf2 = "0.1"

# Full I/O with lazy loading (default)
threemf2 = { version = "0.1", features = ["io-lazy-read"] }

# Memory-constrained environments
threemf2 = { version = "0.1", features = ["io-lazy-read"], default-features = false }

# High-performance reading
threemf2 = { version = "0.1", features = ["io-speed-optimized-read"] }
```

## Examples

The [examples/](examples/) directory contains runnable examples for different use cases:

- **`write.rs`** - Create and write 3MF packages
- **`builder_example.rs`** - Using ModelBuilder for ergonomic model construction
- **`unpack.rs`** - Lazy loading with `ThreemfPackageLazyReader`
- **`io_memory_optimized_read.rs`** - Memory-efficient reading
- **`io_speed_optimized_read.rs`** - High-performance reading
- **`string_extraction.rs`** - Access raw XML content
- **`beamlattice_write.rs`** - Working with beam lattice extensions

Run examples with:

```bash
cargo run --example write --features io-write
cargo run --example unpack --features io-lazy-read
```

## Benchmarks

The benchmarks use Criterion.rs as the benchmark harness on stable Rust channel. 
To run the benchmarks, it shall be compiled and run with `--all-features` flag. The files used for the benchmarks are also on `git lfs`, hence `git lfs` shall be enabled. 

- **reader** - Benchmarks the different serialization options instant-xml and serde-roxmltree on an uncompressed 3MF model file.

- **threemf_reader** - Benchmarks the different reader methods on ThreemfPackage. 

- **threemf_write** - Benchmarks the writer method on a full 3MF package.

## API Overview

### Core Data Structures

- `Model` - Root 3MF model with resources and build configuration
- `Object` - 3D objects (meshes or component assemblies)
- `Mesh` - Triangle mesh geometry with vertices and triangles
- `Component` - Object references with transforms

### Package I/O

- `ThreemfPackage` - Eager loading - loads all data upfront
- `ThreemfPackageLazyReader` - Lazy loading - loads metadata first, data on-demand

## Reading and Writing easily through `io` crate

- `query` module enables easy retrieval of data from the 3MF Package or 3MF model.
- `builder` enables easy creation of 3MF Model.

## Building & Testing

### Requirements

- Rust 1.89.0 or later (2024 edition)
- Cargo package manager

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build with all features
cargo build --all-features

# Check formatting and linting
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

### Testing

```bash
# Install cargo-all-features and run tests for multiple feature combinations at once
cargo all-features test

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench --features "io-memory-optimized-read,io-speed-optimized-read"
```
